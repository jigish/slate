# Installing Slate #

**Note:** You must turn on the Accessibility API!

When *Slate* starts it asks you if it can enable access for assistive devices. It may fail to do so. You can manually set this by checking System Preferences > Universal Access > Enable access for assistive devices. If you are on Mavericks or Yosemite, you must turn it on by checking *Slate* in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility.
